### Tutorial week 01

As the tutorials are timetabled before the lecture on Mondays, in week 01 the tutorial will be a chance to revise some basic principles of differentiation of single-variable functions, before we generalise this to multi-variable functions in the first lecture and beyond. 

From week 02 and beyond the normal pattern will be that each week's tutorial focuses on tutorial problems relating to the previous week's lecture. This will allow you time to review the week's topic(s) and prepare tutorial questions before the relevant tutorial takes place.
