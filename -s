<p>As the tutorials are timetabled before the lecture on Mondays, in
week 01 the tutorial will be a chance to revise some of the basic
principles of differentiation of single-variable functions, before we
generalise this to multi-variable functions in the first lecture and
beyond.</p>
<p>From week 02 and beyond the normal pattern will be that each week’s
tutorial focuses on tutorial problems relating to the previous week’s
lecture. This will allow you time to review the week’s topic(s) and
prepare tutorial questions before the relevant tutorial takes place.</p>

<p>We will condsider a selection of problems from last year’s Calculus
textbook, <em>APEX Calculus</em>. The links below take you to the
